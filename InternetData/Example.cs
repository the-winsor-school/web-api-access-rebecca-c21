/*
  JSON (Java Script Object Notation)
  Concise, short-hand notation for transmitting the "state" of an object.
  That is, values for all of the Properties of a given instance of an object.
  This representation tells us only the structure of the Properties of the class,
  and nothing about the Behaviors that the class might have.

  This notation also need not be a /complete/ inventory of all of the possible
  properties (as we will see with the results of API calls)
